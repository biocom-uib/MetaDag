## MetaDag example supplementary material

This repository contains the supplementary material for the MetaDag web application, which has been developed by the Bioinformatics group at the University of the Balearic Islands.

It should be noted that this repository contains only the source code that produces the reports with Rstudio and Quarto.

In order to reproduce the research, it is necessary to download the data from the HASSSSH experiment address.
